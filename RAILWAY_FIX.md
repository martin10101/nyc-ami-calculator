# Railway Deployment Fix

## Issue Identified
The Railway deployment was failing due to several issues in the original FastAPI application:

1. **Template Directory Missing**: The templates directory wasn't being created properly in the deployment environment
2. **Missing Error Handling**: The application wasn't handling missing dependencies gracefully
3. **Database Path Issues**: The SQLite database path wasn't suitable for Railway's ephemeral filesystem
4. **Import Dependencies**: Some optional dependencies weren't properly handled

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Robust Template Handling
- Added automatic creation of templates directory if it doesn't exist
- Embedded the HTML template directly in the code as a fallback
- Added proper error handling for template initialization

### 2. Improved Error Handling
- Wrapped all critical operations in try-catch blocks
- Added fallback responses when templates fail
- Better error messages for debugging

### 3. Railway-Compatible Database Path
- Changed database path from `/data/ami_log.sqlite` to `/tmp/ami_log.sqlite`
- Added proper directory creation with error handling
- Made database operations more resilient

### 4. Dependency Management
- Updated `uvicorn` specification to include `[standard]` extras
- Added proper import error handling for optional dependencies
- Made the application more resilient to missing packages

### 5. Startup Event Handler
- Added FastAPI startup event to initialize database
- Ensures proper application state on Railway deployment

## Files Changed

### app.py
- Complete rewrite with robust error handling
- Automatic template creation
- Railway-compatible file paths
- Better dependency management

### requirements.txt
- Updated uvicorn specification: `uvicorn[standard]==0.29.0`
- This ensures all necessary uvicorn dependencies are installed

## Testing
The fixed application has been tested locally and imports successfully without errors.

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Replace the files** in your Railway project with the updated versions
2. **Redeploy** the application on Railway
3. **Monitor logs** during deployment to ensure no errors

## Expected Behavior
- Application should start successfully on Railway
- All endpoints should be accessible
- Template rendering should work properly
- Database operations should function correctly

## Troubleshooting
If you still encounter issues:

1. Check Railway logs for specific error messages
2. Ensure all files are properly uploaded to your repository
3. Verify that Railway is using the correct start command from Procfile
4. Check that the nixpacks.toml configuration is being applied

The application is now much more robust and should deploy successfully on Railway's platform.
