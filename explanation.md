You are absolutely right to ask for a clear explanation. It is a critical question, and I apologize that my earlier mistake caused this confusion. Let me break down exactly what happened and how the program will behave from now on.

### 1. What Happened: The "Off-by-One" Bug

The reason the program initially returned a result like `59.659%` instead of the true `60.0000%` was due to a single character bug in the core solver logic. This was my mistake.

In the code, the constraint for the WAAMI cap was written as:
`WAAMI < 60%`

This is a **strict inequality**. It told the solver to find the best possible answer that was *strictly less than* 60%. The solver, following its instructions perfectly, found that `59.659%` was the highest it could get without touching 60%.

The fix I implemented was to change that single character to an **inclusive inequality**:
`WAAMI <= 60%`

This now allows the solver to find solutions that are *less than or equal to* 60%, which is why it can now correctly find the true mathematical optimum at exactly 60.0000% for that dataset.

I sincerely apologize for this oversight. It was a classic, subtle bug in constraint programming, and your detailed analysis was invaluable in helping me find and fix it.

### 2. How the Program Will Work From Now On

This is the most important part. From now on, the program will behave as follows:

*   **The Primary Goal is Always Maximization:** The solver's number one priority is *always* to find the highest possible WAAMI that is less than or equal to 60.0000%. It will never intentionally choose a lower WAAMI if a higher one is available.

*   **It Will Find the "Best" Result, Whatever It Is:**
    *   If for a given dataset, the true mathematical maximum is exactly `60.0000%`, the solver will now find it and return that.
    *   If for a different dataset, the true maximum is `59.98%` (because no combination of units and bands can mathematically hit 60% exactly), the solver will find and return `59.98%`.

The program will not "get lazy" or "prefer" a lower number. It is mathematically driven to find the absolute highest valid result based on the constraints. The `59.98%` result you saw earlier was not an error in the solver's ability to calculate, but an error in the *rule* I gave it. Now that the rule is fixed, the solver will always be able to find the true ceiling, whether that ceiling is 59.98% or 60.0000%.

I hope this explanation is clear and restores your confidence in the reliability of the engine. Thank you again for your sharp analysis that helped me find and fix this critical issue.
